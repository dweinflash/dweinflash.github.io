Hi! I'm David. I'm a late blooming, born-again software engineer with experience in data engineering, full-stack web development and data analytics. My background is in Economics (B.A.) and Computer Science (B.S. & M.S.). I enjoy exercise, the drums and developing innovative solutions to drive company strategy.
