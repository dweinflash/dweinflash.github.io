Quality of experience (QoE) has become an increasingly important metric for todayâ€™s modern service providers.
Discovering and optimizing the factors that determine user experience has thus become an essential goal for
network operators. In this project, I teamed with the [Mobility Management and Networking (MOMENT) Lab](https://moment.cs.ucsb.edu/) 
at UC Santa Barbara to focus on exploring the link between key radio measurements and user experience in the context of video streaming sessions.

## Goals

* Explore several machine learning algorithms to predict quality of experience from radio and network measurements.

  * Random Forest
  * ARIMA 
  * Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)

* Investigate the effect of radio measurements and quality of service (QoS) metrics on quality of experience.

  * **Radio Measurement**: Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)
  * **Quality of Service Measurement**: Throughput

## Takeaways

* Random Forest and ARIMA can be used to predict buffer level with high accuracy, precision and recall.

  * Random forest model was especially effective in segmenting network level measurements using both a quantile binning and uniform binning approach.
    
  * ARIMA able to quickly output accurate predictions on QoE using a linear regression model based on lagged observations.
  
* Simpler models perform noticeably better than compute-intensive LSTM networks.
